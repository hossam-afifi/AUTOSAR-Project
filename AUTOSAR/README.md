AUTOSAR was founded as a worldwide development partnership in 2003. The objective of 
this global cooperation was to establish an industry standard in the field of automotive 
software architecture for OEMs and suppliers. Until now major specification releases have 
been produced, which are in use for several series projects of the different partners. 
AUTOSAR enables complexity management of integrated E/E architectures through increased reuse 
and simplifies collaboration between different partners by providing a unified language 
and methodology. From 2013, AUTOSAR will enter a new phase that represents a further evolutionary step 
towards deployment into world-wide series production.
